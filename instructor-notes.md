title: Instructor Notes

## General idea
This lesson material can be used in a 1-day workshop in which participants work towards 
a reproducibility check by their peers at the end of the day.

In contrast with other Carpentries-style workshops the material is intended to be used entirely self-paced.
Typically, a topic is introduced quickly, but then, participants go through the lesson material on their own pace,
working towards making their own coding project reproducible, and learning as they go. 
Instructors and helpers can then walk around the (virtual) room and answer individual questions.

## Pre-workshop assignment
[episode 1: Pre-workshop assignment: Uploading a coding project to GitHub](episodes/github.md) 
is intended to be finished **before the workshop**. 
Typically, the experience with GitHub is what varies the most between participants and this allows participants
to learn about that in their own pace (or just upload their project to GitHub in a few minutes when they are already used to using version control).
During the workshop we can then focus on making the code reproducible.

When you advertise the workshop it is important to make it really clear that the pre-workshop assignment 
is a mandatory prerequisite for the workshop. 
So: write it in the email title, write it in bold on the registration page, send a reminder! 
Also mention that you are available to answer question through email before the workshop. 
In our experience we achieve a 100% rate of participants completing the pre-workshop assignment.
